# TTrack (T-shot tracker)

Flo’s discipline, but for T. Track your injection schedule and inventory, log shots, get gentle reminders, and (optionally) track periods.

## Tech

- Expo (React Native)
- AsyncStorage (MVP) → SQLite later
- Zustand for state
- date-fns for time math

## Scripts

- `npm start` – run the app
- `npm ios` / `npm android` – platform launch

## Roadmap

- [ ] Schedule + reminders
- [ ] Log shots (dose/site/notes)
- [ ] Site rotation
- [ ] Optional period tracker
- [ ] Export CSV
